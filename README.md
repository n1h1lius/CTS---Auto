                           NOTES
===========================================================

    Take into account that this is an autoclicker, so
    despite you'll still be able to use the mouse inside
    the game and interact with all its features, the
    moment you switch to another window, keys will be
    pressed on that window.

    Nevertheless, the focus will quickly switch back
    to the game, so you can watch a film or do other
    simple tasks that do not require for you to use
    your mouse nor keyboard.

===========================================================

 · DELAY

        Modifies the delay time of the autoclicker to
        start in seconds.

 · PROCESS

        In case the game Cell to Singularity changes its
        name, either the process name, either the game
        name, either the window name, this is what
        you'll have to change.

        Make sure you write the name of the game process
        window, for it is what's needed to start the
        autoclicker.
